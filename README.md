 steady heat conduction in a two-dimensional slab without internal heat generation.
 The temperature in the slab is governed by
 ∇2T(x,y) = 0, 0 <x<1, 0<y <1.
 The boundary conditions are,
 T(0,y) = T(x,1) = 0, T(x,0) = 1, 
 ∂T/∂x =0 at x=1
solved this numerically by different iterative schemes;
1 . point jacobi
2 . gauss seidel
3 . successive over relaxation
